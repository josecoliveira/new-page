abstract: Our goal is to use subjective logic (SL), a quantitative logic with uncertainty, to model agents' opinions and uncertainty, and their changes over time, in social networks. In this paper, we discuss the desired properties for an opinion update function in this setting. We show that SL's predefined belief update functions do not satisfy these properties, and we define a new belief update function satisfying the desired properties. We show that a special case of opinions in SL with our new update function corresponds to earlier (non-logical) work on social networks (Alvim 2019), and that the inclusion of uncertainty strictly extends this earlier work.
